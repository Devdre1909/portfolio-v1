                  Hi!. Iâ€™m Temitope, and Engineering and Tech just fascinates
                  me. My interest in programming started out around 2016, when I
                  had my first interaction with an android smartphone and most
                  of the games I tried out just didn't seem interesting enough,
                  so I decided to find out how games are created.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Moving on to the present day, I have been privileged to work
                  with a an{" "}
                  <a className="text-brand-orange hover:underline cursor-pointer">
                    IT consultancy agency
                  </a>{" "}
                  , where I gained most of my experience in teaching,
                  leadership, communication, management and engineering, some
                  startups like MyExtraSheet,{" "}

                  as Frontend Lead.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I've built product that solve real-life problems and help
                  business automate processes with focus on user experience,
                  fast delivery and high quality using advanced web
                  technologies, and like some of my clients world say "
                  <i>Damilare builds pixel perfect apps</i>". following the UI
                  design to detail.

                <p>
                  Recently, because of my lead roles I have been focusing more
                  on Front End Engineering and working better with both the
                  UI/UX Designer and the Backend Engineers.
